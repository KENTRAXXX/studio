- My Store Configuration: Includes a 'Template Selector' with three layout options, a form to upload a 'Store Logo' and 'Favicon', and a 'Launch' button that updates a Firestore document status to 'Live'.
- Product Catalog: Display a grid of products pulled from a 'Master_Catalog' collection. Each product card should show a high-res image, a wholesale price, and a gold button labeled 'Clone to My Store'. When clicked, show a success toast message: 'Product successfully synced to your custom domain.'
- Domain Settings: Create a 'Domain Settings' page. Add an input field for 'Enter your custom domain (e.g., example.com)'. Below it, create an instruction card with a gold border that displays DNS settings: Type: A Record | Name: @ | Value: 123.456.78.9 Type: CNAME | Name: www | Value: https://www.google.com/search?q=proxy.soma.com Add a 'Verify Connection' button that switches from a gold 'Checking...' state to a green 'Connected' checkmark icon.
- Plan Selection: Build a 'Plan Selection' screen for SOMA. Create two high-contrast luxury cards side-by-side. Card 1 (Monthly): Title 'The Scaler', Price '$29/mo', includes 'Full Platform Access', 'Standard Support', and 'Automated Sync'. Card 2 (Lifetime): Title 'The Mogul', Price '$500 One-Time', includes 'Everything in Monthly', 'VIP Priority Support', and 'Zero Future Fees'. Add a gold 'Best Value' ribbon to this card. Below the cards, add a 'Confirm Selection' button. Use logic so that when a card is clicked, it gets a thick gold border highlight. Ensure the UI is deep black and gold. Below the button, add a note: 'All plans include custom domain mapping and unlimited product imports.
- Master Admin Dashboard: Build a 'Master Admin' hidden dashboard for the SOMA platform. This is for the owner only. It must include: Global Inventory: A table to add/edit products that get pushed to all client stores. Fields: Product Name, Master Cost, Retail Price, Stock Level. Cross-Store Orders: A single list showing every order made across every custom domain on the platform. Revenue Split: A view showing 'Total Platform Sales' vs 'My Commission'. User Management: A list of all 1,000+ store owners with a 'Disable Store' button for those who haven't paid.
- My Orders: Design a 'My Orders' page for SOMA store owners. It should feature a list of all sales made on their custom domain. Columns: Date, Order ID, Customer Email, Total Amount, and Fulfillment Status. Status Tags: 'Processing' (Gold pulse), 'Shipped' (White), 'Delivered' (Solid Gold). Profit Calculator: At the top, show a gold card that calculates 'Gross Revenue' minus 'SOMA Wholesale Cost' to show the user their 'Net Profit'. Action: Add a 'View Details' button for each order that opens a gold-themed modal with the customer's shipping address. Maintain the high-end Black and Gold aesthetic.
- SOMA Wallet: Create a 'SOMA Wallet' page. This is where users manage their earnings. Balance Overview: Large gold text showing 'Available for Withdrawal'. Withdrawal Method: A sleek form to link a Bank Account or PayPal. Transaction History: A list showing 'Sale Earnings' (+), 'Platform Fee' (-), and 'Withdrawals' (Grey). Payout Button: A prominent gold button labeled 'Request Payout'. Use minimalist gold line icons for all financial actions.
- E-commerce Storefront Template: Design a responsive e-commerce storefront template, branded for 'SOMA Client Stores'. The default aesthetic should be deep black with metallic gold accents. Dynamic Components: Header: Dynamic Logo (loaded from client's Firestore settings), Shopping Cart icon, and Search bar. Hero Section: Full-width banner that can display dynamic text and images configured by the client. Product Grid: A clean grid layout displaying products. Each product card should include an image, product name, and a striking gold 'Add to Cart' button. All product data (images, names, prices) must be loaded dynamically from the client's 'products' subcollection in Firestore. Product Detail Page: When a product is clicked, navigate to a dedicated page with larger images, detailed description, 'Add to Cart' and 'Buy Now' buttons (gold). Shopping Cart: A minimalist slide-out cart showing selected items, subtotal, and a gold 'Checkout' button. Footer: Simple footer with dynamic store name and basic links (Privacy Policy, Contact Us). Ensure the template is highly performant and uses modern UI elements with subtle gold animations on hover.
- Checkout Process: Develop a secure, multi-step checkout process for the SOMA client stores. Steps: Information: Input fields for 'Email', 'Shipping Address' (Name, Street, City, State, Zip, Country). Shipping: Display a single 'Standard Shipping' option with a fixed price (e.g., $4.99) in gold text. Payment: Integrate a placeholder for Paystack Checkout (e.g., a credit card form) and display the 'Total Amount Due' in prominent gold text. Ensure a smooth, user-friendly experience with clear validation messages. Upon successful payment, redirect to an 'Order Confirmation' page displaying the order ID. The entire flow must be themed in Black and Gold.
- Store Provisioning: Logic: When a user's payment is confirmed: Create a new document in the 'stores' collection. Copy the 'Master_Settings' (luxury theme, default navigation) into this new document. Deep Clone: Query the 'Master_Catalog' and copy the top 10 'Trending Products' into a sub-collection under the new store called 'active_products'. Assign the 'Store_Status' to 'Live'. Show a progress bar on the dashboard that says: 'Building your luxury storefront...' -> 'Importing premium catalog...' -> 'Going Live!
- Paystack Integration: Create a Paystack integration module for the SOMA checkout page. Frontend: Add a 'Pay Now' button that, when clicked, calls a Firebase Cloud Function to initialize a transaction. Security: The module must pass the 'Customer Email' and 'Amount' (in Kobo or Cents) to the backend. Success Logic: After a successful Paystack popup payment, redirect the user to a '/success' page that displays their Order ID in gold. Aesthetic: Ensure the Paystack payment modal or trigger button matches the Black and Gold luxury theme of SOMA.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Deep Black (#000000) to provide a luxury, high-contrast backdrop.
- Primary color: Metallic Gold (#D4AF37) used as the primary accent color to create an atmosphere of opulence.
- Accent color: Light Gray (#D3D3D3), a softer shade from a neighboring hue that will provide a subdued but accessible secondary contrast, making the text clear against the black backdrop.
- Headline font: 'Montserrat' (sans-serif) for headings to give a bold and modern aesthetic.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to maintain readability and a clean design.
- Use minimalistic line icons with metallic gold (#D4AF37) to complement the luxurious design.
- Cards: Use a 1px solid gold border (#D4AF37) with a slight dark grey background (#0A0A0A) to create a layered effect.
- Subtle gold glow effect on button hover to provide interactive feedback.
