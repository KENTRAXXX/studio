    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to ensure authorization independence, clarity, and scalability. The core approach is to leverage path-based ownership and denormalization to avoid complex security rules that rely on `get()` calls. The `SupportTicket` model is structured under the `/stores/{storeId}/supportTickets/{supportTicketId}` path. This structure enables efficient querying and ensures that all support tickets within a store share the same security context. No `get()` calls are required because we assume that only users with access to the `/stores/{storeId}` document have access to the support tickets associated with that store.\n\nThis structure supports the required QAPs (Rules are not Filters) by allowing direct and secure `list` operations on the `/stores/{storeId}/supportTickets` collection, without needing to filter based on user roles or permissions."
